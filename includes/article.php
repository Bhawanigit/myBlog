							    <h5> How to access your Apple apps and data from an Android device</h5>
								<b>Switching to Android doesn't mean all your Apple data is

								<p> Your information isn’t completely bound to the Apple ecosystem. 
								   Maybe you use an iPhone at home and an Android phone for work, are 
								   thinking about switching from Apple to Google hardware, or just need
								   to take a look at some iCloud data on an Android tablet. Whatever the
								   reason, accessing your iCloud data from an Android device isn’t quite 
								   as tricky as you might think.
								    <br>
									It’s by no means a seamless process, but the existence of apps like Apple Music
									and the improvements
									the Cupertino-based company has made to the iCloud web platform and users’
									ability to connect with its services on non-Apple hardware mean it’s no longer the frustrating exercise it once was. Hopefully, this trend will continue.
